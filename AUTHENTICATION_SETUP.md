    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(user_id, product_id)
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE user_favorites ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for users to manage their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own favorites" ON user_favorites
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create indexes for performance
